for it was just last year when we were together
both of us under the christmas weather.
It was a place where we both built a home
a house made of snow, for it was a dome.
With slaves to help us we crafted an igloo
I can't think of anything that rhymes with igloo.
Anyways at that very spot
is where you will find the rest of the gift. :)
